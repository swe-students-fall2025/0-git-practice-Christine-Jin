# Why Software Is Eating the World?

The most fascinating aspect of this article lies in its foresight—this 2011 piece accurately captured the disruptive power of software on traditional industries, and nearly everything we witness today validates this prediction. His assertion that “software is eating the world” is no exaggeration; it reveals a core logic: in the digital age, software is no longer a supplementary tool for businesses but the very essence of their competitive advantage. From retail (Amazon) and finance (Alipay) to transportation (Uber), companies that pioneered software-driven business process transformation have indeed “devoured” market share from traditional models, just as the article predicted.



More thought-provoking is the article's emphasis that “software companies are fundamentally internet companies.” At the time, many failed to recognize that software combined with network effects could generate exponential influence—today's social media, cloud computing, and AI tools are direct extensions of this logic. This foundational assessment of technological trends not only explains the industry transformations of the past decade but continues to guide future innovation. This, perhaps, is why the article remains so frequently cited to this day.
